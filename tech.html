        <h3>My love for Technology.</h3>
        <p>My name is Eke Ukeni.</p>
        <p>Ask any many of primary school children what they want to be when they grow up and the majority will respond with lawyers, teachers, firefighters, doctors, astronauts etc. Not many will mention technology careers until they are older. Yet technology is one of the fastest growing career paths and hopefully those kids will learn to love the industry just as I do. Here's why I love technology:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b><i>It's ever-changing:</i></b>There's never a dull moment! The the techniques of shaping tools are taken as the chief evidence of the beginning of human culture. On the whole, technology has been a powerful force in the development of civilization.
            </li>
            <li><b><i>Diverse range of customers:</i></b> We get to support all kinds of organisations while they achieve remarkable things. From helping the biggest call centre in Africa to run efficiently with programming provided 'as a Service', to aged care centres that need support to meet stringent compliance standards, we get to see numerous customers need technological services.</li>
            <li><b><i>The huge challenge:</i></b> It is a great career for problem solvers and dreamers alike and when they team up, the magic happens! The feeling of working towards a solution that forges a new path, or of unravelling a problem that has drawn upon our combined knowledge and expertise is tremendously satisfying/loving.
            </li>
            <li><b><i>True equality:</i></b>I firmly believe that the more diverse technology is, the stronger programmers. The only thing that matters is a person's contribution in team work - their efforts, dedication and skills - regardless of gender, nationality or ethnicity. I am happy to say that at Stutern we are truly learning to embrace and encourage diversity.</li>
            <li><b><i>It's Job Demanding:</i></b>The world needs software engineers now more than ever. There is such a demand for tech talent, and currently there are more ideas for software products than people to build them. Programming requires creative thinking, and a competent understanding of human needs - and so machines won't easily replace that unlike some other career fields.</li>
            <li><b><i>Continuous learning:</i></b>While learning new technologies is important, it's even more important to understand organisations. For any project to work, we must learn about its significance to our client organisation. This means studying the intricate processes and interdependencies that allow them to provide a service- all of it equips us for future challenges.</li>
            <p>While it certainly isn't for anyone seeking predictability, technology is an industry that rewards the innovators and hard workers. For anyone with curiosity, work ethic and a drive to help customers get more from technology, the opportunities are endless. And for those youngsters wondering what their future might hold, chances are, whatever they choose, it will involve technology in one way or another.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>My learning progresses and importance of CSS</h3>
        <p>In the course of my learning of software engineer in Stutern, Cohort 1.4, I have learned so many things. Below is a list of main areas I have benefited alots:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li><b><i>Git:</i></b> In Git, I have learnt the following:</li>
            <ol type="i">
                <li> what Git is and successfully installed Git tools. </li>
                <li>Understood common git workflows</li>
                <li>Understood the difference between distributed and centralized version control systems</li>
                <li>Learnt how to collaborate on projects effectively</li>
            </ol>
            <li><b><i>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML):</i></b> In HTML, I have learnt the following: </li>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>HTML tools and building blocks.</li>
                <li>HTML Formatting, headings, and Paragraphs.</li>
                <li>HTML Skeleton, links, and Images.</li>
                <li>HTML Tables, Lists, and Forms.</li>
            </ol>
            <li><b><i>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):</i></b> In Css, I have learnt the followinng:</li>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>CSS is used for styling the web page.</li>
                <li>CSS type/methods.</li>
                <li>CSS selectors.</li>
                <li>CSS box model. </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Importance of CSS:</h3>
        <p>CSS is very important in the development of websites.</p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li><b><i>Help web pages load faster:</i></b> CSS has an underappreciated but critical benefit of speeding up page loading times. CSS rules are downloaded once and cached so that all pages of a website can be loaded quickly. It improves the overall user experience by speeding up website navigation. </li>
            <li><b><i>Compatible with multiple browsers:</i></b> All web browsers are compatible with CSS. As a result, all web browsers will display a CSS-based website in the same way. </li>
            <li><b><i>Mobile-Friendly Web Pages:</i></b> Another key importance of CSS is that it allows you to print user-friendly web pages. This means that web pages can be printed without difficulty. Colors, pictures, and other difficult-to-print objects can all be removed and printed with ease. </li>
            <li><b><i>Customization:</i></b> Users can customise the web page using CSS sheets. CSS sheets are externally stored and allow the user to make modifications as needed. Users can define their own style sheets in a number of recent browsers. As a result, a user can quickly adjust the font's attributes</li>
            <li><b><i>User-friendly search engine:</i></b> CSS style sheets help websites appear more prominently in search engine results. Because it allows you to move items anywhere on the page, the user can begin projecting the main material so that web crawlers can quickly catch it. It also generates cleaner HTML and CSS in web development codes, lowering the amount of time Web Spider has to spend searching for meaningful content among the clutter. </li>
            <li><b><i>Display options:</i></b> Another prevalent web design challenge is the growing requirement to make websites accessible via many media. CSS may assist you address this problem by allowing you to build different display styles for the same HTML page: for example, you can construct a distinct style sheet for printing or a mobile device. </li>
            <li><b><i>Bandwidth reduction:</i></b> When you use CSS to isolate your website's content from its design language, you can drastically minimise the size of your file transmission. Your CSS document will be stored outside of your website and will only be accessed once when a visitor requests it. When you design a website with tables, on the other hand, every page of your website is available at every visit. Your lower bandwidth needs will result in a faster load time and maybe lower web hosting expenses. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Summarily, CSS in web development programming, are methods of instructing your browsers on what to do with your web structures.</p>

        <h3>Paddings, Margins and Borders explained</h3>
        <p><b><i>Paddings:</i></b> The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders. With CSS, you have full control over the padding.

        <p><b>Note:</b>Negative values are not allowed.</p>
        <p><b><i>Margins:</i></b> The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b>Negative values are allowed.</p>
        <p><b><i>Borders</i></b> The CSS Border properties are used to generate space between the paddings and margins. It allows you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.</p>

        <h2>Border Style</h2>
        <p>The border-style property can have from one to four values (for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border).</p>
